# Dot files

## Convention

The dotfiles listed in this repository follow the following convention:

**No leading dots:**

Leading dots are removed, re-add them before usage.
For example, `zshrc` is actually `.zshrc`.

**Dashes represent directory names:**

For example: `ssh-config` should be `.ssh/config`
